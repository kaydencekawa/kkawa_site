I built a dashboard in R Shiny using data on state spending on kids from the Urban Institute. There’s an option to either select spending on PK-12th grade or Parks and Recreation, and a checklist for each state you’d like to display. To normalize the spend across states, I indexed the amounts in the chart to the first year (1997). The data table below the chart includes the raw spend, and a column for percent change from one year to the next. After selecting the spend category and states, the chart and data table will update.
